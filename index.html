        I am a web developer, teacher, and musician, and I'd like to work with
        you on something phenomenal.</p>
      <p>
        While I've done many things and lived in many places, coding has been

        with you that I've learned after many adventures:

        <em>The three things that are most important for success are:
          creativity, the ability to adapt and learn, and people.</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Web development has been my passion for many years. Now
        it's my trade.
